# Concrete_Strength_Research

The project's goal is to determine under which circumstance can we get the most compressive-resistant concrete. The eight attributes that can cause the variety of concrete compressive resistance are:

·Cement

·Blast furnace slag

·Fly ash

·Water

·Superplasticizer

·Coarse aggregate

·Fine aggregate

·Age (means the period of time between concrete is cast and being used)
